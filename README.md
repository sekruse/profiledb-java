# ProfileDB

ProfileDB is thought as a tool to alleviate the instrumentation and evaluation of applications. This project is a library for the instrumentation of JVM applications and the serialization of gathered results. Check out the [Python client](https://github.com/sekruse/profiledb-python) to load results, e.g., into an IPython notebook in order to visualize them.

## Instructions

ProfileDB is available via Maven Central. Check the [latest release](https://github.com/sekruse/profiledb-java/releases/latest) for details. Otherwise, you can build ProfileDB yourself using Maven.
